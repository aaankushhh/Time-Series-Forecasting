# Data Analysis in the Cloud Research Repository

Welcome to the **Data Analysis in the Cloud** research repository. This repository contains the code and findings from my research project focused on time series forecasting using various algorithms on IoT Sensor Dataset.

## Algorithms
Following algorithms were used on sensor data to perform time series forecasting.

1. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
2. AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
3. Prophet
4. XGBoost

The code for each algorithm's implementation can be found in the IoT Sensor dataset directory.

## Performance Evaluation
I benchmarked the performance of each algorithm by evaluating the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values.
